# JSON-Parser

***Overview***:
The Android application is designed to display employee data stored in a local [JSON file][0]. It loads the JSON data, parses it, and presents it in a user-friendly format using a RecyclerView. The user interface shows employee names, ages, and cities. The app includes error handling to display a message if no records are found in the JSON data. Overall, it serves as a basic employee data viewer for mobile devices.
